# Deployment of CourageousSearch
CourageousSearch (CS) is an opensource project. It is hosted at:  
[Github:seanoc5/courageoussearch](https://github.com/seanoc5/courageoussearch)


## Getting Started
- [sdkman](https://sdkman.io/install) is a nice option for grails/groovy/jdk and a bunch of other things _(**optional** but helpful)_ 
- install groovy 3.0.11
- install [Grails](https://grails.org/) (5.2.4)  
  - grails will download/use the proper gradle (7.2)  
    - note: I had problems with Gradle 8 getting mixed in because I was sloppy, beware! 
- install/use JDK 11 (or perhaps up to 16??)
- clone CourageousSearch [repo](https://github.com/seanoc5/courageoussearch)
  - todo - add git command with sample dir
- build
  - todo - add gradlew build cmd
- bootRun



## Todo


# Other & Miscellaneous
- See Readme.Developer.md if you have interest in the code, grails, etc
- **NOTE**: CourageousSearch is the opensource foundation of the proprietary CorpusMinder (CM) software. More to come on CM in the summer of 2024...
